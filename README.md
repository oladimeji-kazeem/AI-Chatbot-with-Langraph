# ðŸ¤– End-to-End AI Chatbot with Langraph, FastAPI, and Streamlit UI

Welcome to the **End-to-End AI Chatbot** project! This repository demonstrates a full-stack implementation of an intelligent chatbot application powered by **Langraph** for conversational logic, **FastAPI** as the backend API server, and **Streamlit** for a clean and interactive web-based UI.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project showcases how to build and deploy a robust, modular, and scalable AI chatbot from end to end. It integrates:

- **Langraph**: A graph-based language agent orchestration framework.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… Langraph for structured conversation flow and tool integration
- âœ… FastAPI backend to serve and manage chat sessions via RESTful APIs
- âœ… Streamlit frontend for easy-to-use, responsive chatbot interaction
- âœ… Support for GPT-based LLMs (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.)
- âœ… Modular and extensible design
- âœ… API authentication & logging
- âœ… Easily deployable locally or in the cloud (e.g., Render, HuggingFace Spaces)

## ðŸ§  Architecture

```text
+-------------+       +--------------+       +-------------+
| Streamlit   | <---> |  FastAPI     | <---> |   Langraph  |
| Frontend UI |       |  Backend API |       |  Chat Agent |
+-------------+       +--------------+       +-------------+

- âœ… Streamlit handles user input/output.
- âœ… FastAPI receives the input, routes it to Langraph, and sends back the response.
- âœ… Langraph defines the conversational agent, tools, memory, and logic.
